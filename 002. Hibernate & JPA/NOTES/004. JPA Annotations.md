When we have to map the Java objects to teh database tables, we use the annotations in Spring Boot. We can either say "Hibernate" annotations or "JPA" annotations because in Spring Boot, "Hibernate" is the default implementation of JPA.

So, going forward, we will simply use the term "JPA".

Let's talk about some annotations in JPA.

# @ENTITY ANNOTATION

An Entity Class is the Java class that is mapped to a database table. To make any class as an Entity class, we have the @Entity annotation.

For example, suppose we have a "Student" class with id, firstName, lastName, and email.

When JPA maps it to a database table, it will create a new table named "student" which has four columns "id", "first_name", "last_name" and "email".

    @Entity
    public class Student {...}

The minimum requirements for a class to be an Entity class are - 

    1. It should have the @Entity annotation
    2. It should have a public or protected no-argument constructor. It can have other constructors but they are optional.

Just a small constructor refresher - 

    1. If you do not declare any constructors in your class, Java will provide a no-argument constructor to you.
    2. If you declare constructors with arguments, then you do not get a no-argument constructor. In this case, you have to explicitly declare one.

Now, you may think, what about the entity name? Well, by default, the name is the class name. But, we can set custom name by providing a "name" parameter in the @Entity annotation.

    @Entity(name="student")
    public class Student {...}

It is important to note that "Entity" classes must not be declared as "final" because many JPA implementations will try to subclass our entity to provide their functionality. And as we know, a "final" class cannot be extended to create a subclass. That's why, we should not declare "Entity" classes as "final".

# @TABLE ANNOTATION

This annotation is used to specify the table name. This annotations can accept for attributes -> name, schema, catalog and uniqueConstraints.

For example, we want to map our "Student" class to a table named "student" in the database. So, we will write - 

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {...}

If we do not use the @Table annotation, Spring Boot will take the table name as the name of the entity. But, it is recommended that you explicitly provide the table name so that in the future, code refactoring (such as changing the name of Entity class name) does not affect the mapping.

# @ID ANNOTATION

Each JPA entity must have a primary key that uniquely identifies it. The @Id annotation defines the primary key. We can generate the identifiers in different ways, which are specified by the @GeneratedValue annotation.

There are four Id generation strategies that we can choose - 

    1. AUTO
    2. TABLE
    3. SEQUENCE
    4. IDENTITY

"AUTO" means any strategy can be chosen by the JPA provider. This is also the default type.

"TABLE" means JPA provider must use a database table to generate/keep the next unique primar key for the entities.

"SEQUENCE" means the JPA provider must use a database sequence to get the next unique primary key for the entities.

"IDENTITY" means the JPA provider must assign primary keys using a database identity column. IDENTITY column is typically used in SQL Server. Basically, using this we are telling the JPA providers to let the database handle the auto incrementing of the id.

So, let's say that in our Student class, we want the "id" column to be the primary key. So, we can use @Id annotation on it.

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        private int id;
    }

The "Identity" GenerationType is recommended in most of the cases.

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        private int id;
    }

# @COLUMN ANNOTATION

This annotation is used to tell Spring Boot which class property maps to which column. In a lot of cases, the column name will not be same as the class property so we have to explicitly tell Spring Boot about that using @Column annotation.

For example, the class property is "firstName" but in the database table, column is "first_name". So, we have to explicitly mention this - 

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        private int id;

        @Column(name="first_name")
        private String firstName;
    }

If we donâ€™t specify this annotation, the name of the column in the table will be the name of the field. For example, in case of the "id". 

But, this is something you should avoid because suppose if we refactor the java code sometime in the future. If we change the class property names, it will affect the mapping as well. But, if we use the @Column annotation on all the properties, then it does not matter what the class property is named.

    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        @Column(name="id")
        private int id;

        @Column(name="first_name")
        private String firstName;
    }

This @Column annotation also takes some other attributes like "length", "nullable" and "unique".

The "length" element specifies its length. The "nullable" element specifies whether the column is nullable or not, and the "unique" element specifies whether the column is unique.


# FINAL ENTITY CLASS CODE

This is how our "Student" class should look like after we apply all the annotations that we discussed above -


    @Entity
    @Table(name="student")
    public class Student {

        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        @Column(name = "id")
        private int id;

        @Column(name="first_name")
        private int firstName;

        @Column(name="last_name")
        private int lastName;

        @Column(name="email")
        private int email;

        // No argument constructor (Explicitly defined as we have an argument constructor as well)
        public Student() {}

        // Constructor with arguments
        public Student(int firstName, int lastName, int email) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
            this.email = email;
        }

        // Getter and Setters

        public int getId() {
            return id;
        }

        public void setId(int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }

        public int getFirstName() {
            return firstName;
        }

        public void setFirstName(int firstName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
        }

        public int getLastName() {
            return lastName;
        }

        public void setLastName(int lastName) {
            this.lastName = lastName;
        }

        public int getEmail() {
            return email;
        }

        public void setEmail(int email) {
            this.email = email;
        }

        // toString() Method

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Student{" +
                    "id=" + id +
                    ", firstName=" + firstName +
                    ", lastName=" + lastName +
                    ", email=" + email +
                    '}';
        }
    }
