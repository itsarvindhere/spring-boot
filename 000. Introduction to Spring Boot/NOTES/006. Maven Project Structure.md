When you join a new project, each development team dreams up their own directory structure. It is not ideal for newcomers and not standardized.

Maven solves this problem by providing a standard directory structure.

At the root of the directory, we have the pom.xml file which is the configuration file that has all the information that Maven needs related to the project and its dependencies.

At src/main/java we have the Java source code.

At src/main/resources, we have the properties files or the config files that will be used by our Spring application.

At src/main/webapp, we have the JSP files and web config files and other web assets like images, css, js etc.

At src/test, we have the unit test related code and properties.

Finally, the target directory is for compiled code, and it is created automatically by Maven.

# BENEFITS OF THIS STANDARD DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

Most major IDE's have built-in support for Maven. For example, Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans etc. And IDE's can easily read/import Maven projects.

Maven projects are also portable so Developers can easily share projects between IDEs.
